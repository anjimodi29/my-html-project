    <h2>About Ai study Assistant</h2>
    <p>AI Study Assistant is a smart, AI-powered learning platform developed to help students study more efficiently and effectively. <br> The system is designed to reduce the time spent on reading lengthy study materials by automatically  <br>analyzing documents and presenting key information in a simplified form.

This project focuses on combining modern Artificial Intelligence techniques with educational needs to create a user-friendly study tool that supports self-learning and exam preparation.</p>
<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>AI Study Assistant allows users to upload PDF documents and automatically performs:
    <ul>
        <li>Text extraction and cleaning</li>

<li>Intelligent summarization of content</li>

<li>Automatic generation of important questions and MCQs</li>

<li>Document-based chatbot interaction for instant doubt solving</li>
    </ul>
    All features are designed to work efficiently while maintaining data privacy and ease of use.
    <h2>Technology Used</h2>
    <p>The system is developed using:

Python programming language <br>

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques <br>

Machine Learning algorithms <br>

Offline processing modules for better privacy <br>

This makes the project lightweight, efficient, and suitable for academic environments.</p>
<h2> Our Vision</h2>
<p>Our vision is to enhance the learning experience by integrating intelligent automation into education. We aim to create tools that assist students <br> in understanding concepts better, revising faster, and performing confidently in examinations.</p>
<h2> Project Information</h2>
<p>This application is developed as a minor project by an engineering student to <br> demonstrate practical knowledge of AI, Machine Learning, and software development concepts.</p>
